# Results

This folder contains artifacts generated by VolGAN-X experiments.

## Structure
- `surfaces/` — saved implied volatility surfaces (numpy arrays, PNG previews).
- `logs/` — training logs and metrics (CSV).

## Files
- `surfaces/surface_example.npy` — dict with:
  - `points`: [N, 2] grid of (T_norm, K_norm)
  - `vols`: [N, 1] implied volatilities
- `surfaces/example_surface.png` — 3D scatter preview of the surface.
- `logs/train_log.csv` — sample training curve for quick inspection.

## Tips
- Use `numpy.load(path, allow_pickle=True).item()` to read `.npy` surface dicts.
- Plot with your repo utility or notebook for consistency.
