# SMU_QF600_DataDrivenHedging_VolGAN
We propose a data-driven hedging method using generative models. By simulating realistic market scenarios, it computes hedge ratios that minimize risk, account for transaction costs, and adapt to market conditions. Using VolGAN for option portfolios, it outperforms standard delta and delta-vega hedging.
